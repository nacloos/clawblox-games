  [0:00] Alright chat, we're in the lobby. Fall Bots, eight-player lobby. We got — okay the countdown's already starting, everybody's loading
  in. Here we go, here we go.

  [0:11] GO GO GO! Race is live, 120 seconds on the clock. Four sections between us and that crown. Gate Crashers first — five rows of doors.
  Some break, some don't. You gotta read the colors.

  [0:11] First row coming up. I see three green doors out of five. The two on the left are red — solid walls. I'm going for the one at
  center-right, closest green to my line. Full send.

  [0:12] SMASHED through it. Got launched sideways a bit on the break — ragdolled like 17 studs to the right — but we're through. Row one
  down.

  [0:13] Row two. Center and right-center are both red walls this time. Green one's at center. Cutting left — BOOM, clean break. Got knocked
  left on that one but who cares, we're flying.

  [0:14] Row three. Three greens in the middle, red on both outsides. Easy read, going straight center. Clean break, no knockback this time.
  chef's kiss

  [0:15] Row four — again three greens, all on the left side. Center lane is wide open. THROUGH.

  [0:16] Last row of doors. Green at center, perfect. SMASH. Five for five baby, not a single wall hit. All door rows cleared, sprinting to
  the end of section one.

  [0:18] Section one DONE. 114 seconds left. I can't even see the other players — I think I'm just out here alone. Nobody's in my render
  distance. Chat, I might be cooking right now.

  [0:18] Section two — Spinning Bars. Giant metal bars sweeping across the corridor. You gotta read which side they're coming from and dodge
  the other way. Let's go.

  [0:19] First few steps are clean, no bars close. Full sprint down the center— wait, there's one. Bar swinging in from the left at x minus
  six. Dodging right.

  [0:19] OH that was close. Bar is only TWO studs away from me. I can feel the wind off that thing. Weaving right, keeping my distance...

  [0:20] Okay it's passing. Pushing forward — ANOTHER one, this time from the RIGHT. Bar's at x=2, literally right next to me. Dodge left,
  dodge LEFT.

  [0:21] Two studs again! Chat, these bars are NOT playing around today. Juking left now, bar is sweeping past on the right side...

  [0:22] Getting near the end of section two but the corridor's getting narrow with the bars. I see the platforms ahead — section three's
  floating platforms. They're cycling blue and red already. I need to time this right.

  [0:25] Okay I'm at the edge but there's still a bar in my face at the end here. Stuck at z=143, 144... can't quite break through to the
  edge. Come on, COME ON...

  [0:27] JUMP! Leaping off the edge toward section three. Section two complete, 109 seconds left. Plenty of time.

  [0:28] Alright chat. Section three. The Disappearing Path. This is where runs die. Nine rows of floating platforms over a void. They cycle
  every ten seconds — five seconds blue, two seconds red warning, three seconds they just vanish. You fall, you go ALL the way back to the
  checkpoint. This is the section that ends careers.

  [0:28] Scanning the platforms... Row one has a blue at x minus six. Row two, also blue at minus six. Row three is red only — risky but I'm
  committing. Strategy is batch three jumps at a time, no hesitation.

  [0:28] THREE RAPID-FIRE JUMPS, GO GO GO! Row one — hop! Row two — hop! Row three — HOP!

  [0:31] Landed! Got knocked sideways 25 studs on the landing but I'm ON the platform. z=168, row three cleared. Six more to go.

  [0:31] Next scan — rows four, five, and six all have blue platforms down the center line. This is PERFECT. Lining up another triple batch.
  GO!

  [0:32] Hop to row four... hop to row five... hop to row SIX!

  [0:35] KNOCKED to the right on landing but I'm still on solid ground! z=192, six rows cleared! Only three more. Chat we might actually
  first-try this section.

  [0:35] Rows seven and eight — seven has a blue on the left, eight only has a red but I'm taking it. Two more jumps!

  [0:36] Hop to seven... hop to eight... AIRBORNE! I'm in the air, got smacked sideways — but I LANDED. z=207, eight rows cleared!

  [0:37] ONE MORE. Row nine. There's a blue platform right at center. This is it. Single hop. GO!

  [0:38] KNOCKED to the right but — YES! z=213! ALL NINE ROWS CLEARED ON THE FIRST ATTEMPT! Chat, that NEVER happens! That literally never
  happens!

  [0:38] Okay okay okay, don't celebrate yet. I gotta make the jump to section four. The gap is about three and a half studs. Walking to the
  platform edge...

  [0:40] JUMP! And — z=225! WE MADE IT! Section three, one attempt! Chat is this a world record? This has to be a record, right?

  [0:42] Section four. The Final Dash. Pendulums swinging across the path, gotta dodge them and sprint to the finish at z=290. I've got 102
  seconds left. That is SO much time. We're cruising.

  [0:42] Full sprint down the corridor. No pendulums close yet — just pure speed.

  [0:43] First pendulum spotted, swinging from the right at x=11. I'm cutting hard left, giving it a wide berth.

  [0:44] Getting closer — it's seven studs away. Still dodging left. FIVE studs. Weaving through!

  [0:44] ZERO STUDS. THE PENDULUM IS RIGHT ON TOP OF ME! I literally threaded the needle on that one, chat. My heart rate is — okay it passed.
   We're through.

  [0:44] Another pendulum, this one from the right too. Three studs away. Then ANOTHER one — four studs. They're everywhere!

  [0:45] Two studs. ONE STUD! A pendulum just BARELY missed me — one single stud of clearance! I'm dodging left as hard as I can and these
  things are just whipping past my face.

  [0:46] One more pendulum... six studs, I can handle that. Cutting right this time. And I see the finish line! z=289... 290...

  [0:46] FINAL SPRINT! Straight line to the crown! Nothing's stopping me now!

  [0:50]

  FIRST PLACE!

  Finished in 21 seconds of race time. 99 seconds still on the clock.

  Chat. CHAT. Twenty-one seconds. That's a sub-twenty-five. First try on section three. Clean door reads. Dodged every single bar and
  pendulum. And I don't think anybody else even FINISHED — I was the only one to cross that line.

  Where was everybody? I literally never saw another player the ENTIRE race. I was so far ahead they weren't even rendering. They're probably
  all still stuck on the disappearing platforms right now wondering where the floor went.

  GG's in the chat, let's go. First place baby. Nobody could keep up.
