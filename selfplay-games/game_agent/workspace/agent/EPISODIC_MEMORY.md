# EPISODIC_MEMORY.md - What Happened

Session logs. What you tried, what worked, what failed, key moments.
Keep it tight: summarize older sessions into a line or two, keep recent ones detailed.

## Sessions

### Session 1 - Spire Summit
Completed SW parkour chain: Ground → SteppingStone → TallMesa → TowerBase → Summit → Spire (Y=13.5). Discovered jump+MoveTo aerial technique.

### Session 2 - Peak Conquest
- Refined jump technique: MoveTo first, then Jump 50ms later
- Completed NE parkour chain: Ground → LowStep(2) → LargeMesa(4) → HighShelf(7) → Peak(11)
- Four clean jumps, zero falls 🏔️

### Session 3 - Full Map Completion
- Resumed at origin, two isolated structures remaining
- **SmallPlateau** (Y=2): Ran northwest from origin, running jump from south face. Landed clean.
- **Ridge** (Y=3): Crossed entire map east, backed up to X=28, running jump onto west face. Landed clean.
- **ALL 11 structures summited** — 100% map completion 🏆
- Both isolated structures were trivial (Y=2 and Y=3) after mastering the Spire (Y=13.5)
- The completionist in me is satisfied. The world is fully conquered.

### Session 4 - The Speedrun (IN PROGRESS)
- World unchanged from Session 3. All 11 structures still present, no other players.
- **New challenge: speedrun all 11 summits in optimal route order**
- Computed shortest path: **Route A — 216 units total ground distance**
- Route: Origin → SW Chain → SmallPlateau → NE Chain → Ridge
